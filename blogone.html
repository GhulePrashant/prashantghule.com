        <h2>Laughter</h2>
        <p>
            One of the best feelings in the world which cheer to life is laughter. I will say it is one of the best
            medicines in the world. Whether it's a smile or a giggle, laughter changes the mood and atmosphere of the
            surroundings. It makes us feel good. It gives us positive vibes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Laughter acts as a powerful antidote for pain, stress. I think there is nothing that works faster in order
            to
            bring back mind and body into balance than a good laugh. Also, laughter helps us to lighten our burden,
            connects with the others and keep us focused.

            Laughter has so much power to renew and heal one's body and mind. The ability to laugh frequently is the
            best
            way to surmount the problems. It supports our emotional health. Laughter increases the blood in your body
            and also the functioning of blood vessels. Thus, it can help in protecting a person against a heart attack.

            Additionally, laughter helps you feel good. The good feeling that you actually get during laughter remains
            with you even when you stop laughing. Thus, laughter helps you with a positive view in difficult times. A
            smile or a laugh can do a world of good for you.
